### Report on completed work.

The work took 4-5 days; if fully loaded, the project can be completed in 2 days; due to the lack of complete information, many points were not observed during the layout and adding interactivity to the elements. However, these conditions are met and I work exactly from the idea.

The task was completed. This stack includes:

+ HTML
+ SCSS
+ JS
+ ReactJS
+ Bootstrap (React-Bootstrap)

It is worth noting that of the given technical requirements, the following tasks were not completed:
* work with JQuery
* work with Jekyll

It is worth noting that all functional requirements were met exactly to the end:

- [x] All buttons should be fully functional and trigger the expected actions or events.
- [x] Ensure that the user interface replicates the provided design concept accurately.
